A Robot is any automatically operated machine. In practical usage, a robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous device that performs its tasks either according to direct human control, partial control with human supervision, or completes autonomously. Industrial robots look like pieces of machinery, whereas to be called a humanoid, a robot must meet two main criteria: it has to have a body that resembles a human (head, arms, torso, legs) as well as it has to act like a human in environments specially designed for the capabilities of the human body — like an office or a house.
Since many robots in science fiction look like humans, a humanoid robot may be the default robot for most people. On the other hand, it is difficult to claim that robots should be humanoid robots that are supposed to do some tasks in the real world, considering that aircraft do not look like birds. The required functions for a robot may determine the optimal shape of the robot.
## History of Humanoid Robot
The word ‘Robot’ itself was coined by the Czech playwright Karel Capek from the word robota or forced labor. His play “R.U.R., Rossum’s Universal Robots,” which premiered in Prague in 1922, was about a factory in the near future where synthetic slaves, or robots, were mass produced for export all over the world. 
## Timeline of Humanoid Robot
 - 1495: The rediscovered sketches of Leonardo’s Mechanical Knight which is known to be designed and perhaps constructed in 1495 by Leonardo da Vinci. Basically, it is a warrior, clad in medieval armor, that is capable of some human-like movements.
 - 1810: The first humanoid robot was a soldier with a trumpet, made in 1810 by Friedrich Kaufmann in Dresden, Germany. The robot was on display until at least April 30, 1950.
 - 1921: The concept of artificial humans predates recorded history, but the modern term robot derives from the Czech word "robota," used in Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (1920).
 - 1927: Herbert Televox was the first known Humanoid Robot. Ron Wensley invented it in 1927, and it has a simple process like lifting the phone to answer the call and other simple processes according to the signal received from it.
 - 1952: In 1952, Alan Turing built up the Turing test to decide whether a machine can have an independent perspective.
 - 1967: Waseda University started the WABOT Project in 1967, and it was completed in 1972. It was the world’s first full-scale humanoid robot. It was able to walk, communicate with others in Japanese, navigate, and transport objects to remote areas. 
 - 2000: Honda's ASIMO finally developed a robot after twenty years of research that could walk, jump, etc. At that time, ASIMO was the most advanced robot worldwide. ASIMO's newer versions are still considered some of the most advanced robots in the world.
 - 2006: Aldebaran Robotics releases Nao, a small 2' tall humanoid robot widely used in academic and research areas. Around 5000 Nao are functioning in approximately 50 countries. Nao is human-friendly, programmed for tasks such as helping in company receptions, care homes, and even helping Autistic children.
 - 2010: NASA and General Motors revealed R2, the most advanced Humanoid Robot known to the world designed specially for space research purposes in the outer space station known as Destiny’s laboratory.
 - 2016: Hanson Robotics revealed Sophia, the most advanced humanoid robot known to human who has a passport and Saudi Arabian citizenship
 
## Why is Humanoid Robot Important
Let us discuss why humanoid robots are more salient. For specific usage, non-humanoid robots are efficient. But while working alongside humans, there are some features we need to talk about.
First of all, we designed the environment of modern society in such a way that is efficient for humans. For example, the height of a stair, the position of a handrail, the width of a corridor, etc. If a robot that has wheels instead of feet cannot use stairs, uneven floors, or narrow passages. It should be more economical to develop humanoid robots than to modify the whole environment.
The second feature should imply a similar effect. Most tools for humans are designed to be used by humans. For example, a chair to sit, a table to eat, a driver’s cockpit, etc are made to be used by humans. A screwdriver or scissors can be operated best by articulated fingers. It is more economical to use humanoid robots than to re-design numerous tools. 
The third feature is entertainment. A robot is easily personified when the robot looks like a human. The further a robot is from a human shape, the fewer humans feel a human in the robot. It is fun to watch a biped humanoid robot dancing, but the dancing of a wheeled robot should be less attractive. A human-like shape is crucial to realize a partner robot that can make us enjoy ourselves.
## Some Advanced Humanoid Robots and Usages
### ASIMO
ASIMO is a humanoid robot developed in Japan in 2000. ASIMO is the acronym for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility. The name was chosen in honor of Isaac Asimov. ASIMO is 130cm tall and weighs 54 kg. It has a special ability to recognize moving objects, postures, gestures, sounds, faces, and surroundings. It can also distinguish between faces and voices. It is designed to assist and help people. It can run, dance, hop and play soccer.
### Atlas
Atlas, designed by Boston Dynamics, is the most agile and dynamic robot ever made. It can operate both outdoors and inside buildings. Atlas has whole-body dynamic stabilization. It can lift and carry objects like boxes and crates, but its favorite tricks are running, jumping, and doing backflips. Atlas uses 3D printed parts to give it the strength-to-weight ratio necessary for leaps and somersaults. The latest version of the atlas is a massive improvement from its original version. It is used mainly for research purposes.
### Jia Jia
Jia Jia was first displayed at the 2016 World Robot Conference in Beijing, China. She enthralled the visitors with its unique capabilities. She was developed at the University of Science and Technology of China. It was able to realistically blink and smile throughout the dialogue. It is one of the most human-like robots ever created. Not only can it respond to humans, but it can recognize when someone is taking a picture and make appropriate comments, such as warning not to stand too close for fear of making her face "look fat."
### Digit
Digit is designed primarily as a delivery robot made by Starship Robotics. Digit instead opts for a bipedal design, meaning it walks upright on two legs. The bipedal design allows it to carry out actions like climbing steps while carrying items weighing up to 40 lbs in its arms. In all, it represents a robot that’s far more like the walking robots promised to us in science fiction. Digit is approximately the size and shape of an adult human. It’s able to navigate environments semi-autonomously with the help of LIDAR and other sensors, and it can carry boxes in its arms up to 40 pounds (18 kilograms) in weight. Agility Robotics says it can be put to a range of uses, including in logistics, warehouses, telepresence, and industrial inspection.
### Pepper
Pepper is a friendly humanoid designed to be a companion in the home and help customers at retail stores. It talks, gesticulates, and seems determined to make everyone smile. It was the world's first full-scale humanoid to be offered to consumers in 2015. It has an omnidirectional wheeled base, voice and object recognition and a tablet to display information. It supports twenty languages including Japanese, English, French and Spanish.
### Kime
The 'Kime' robot is a robotic bartender that can speak a dozen languages, make incredible cocktails and has the ability to recognize loyal customers. It was created by the Spanish "food tech" group Macco Robotics. The 5G enabled humanoid robot has the ability to work 24 hours a day and aids in this new Covid reality of social distancing.
### Nadine
Nadine was created in 2013 by Kokoro, Japan. Nadine can show emotions, speak naturally, understand some gestures, and remember and retrieve facts during dialogue sessions. At first, Nadine worked as a Receptionist at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Presently, Nadine is working as a customer service agent at AIA Singapore. She has been trained to handle questions that are usually asked by AIA customers. She even encourages AIA customers to sign up with the AIA e-care registration portal.
### Sophia
Hanson Robotics’ most advanced human-like robot, Sophia, was first activated on February 14, 2016. Soon after that ‘Sophia’ sparked controversy since she has been given citizenship and has done media performances all over the world. Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first Innovation Champion in 2017. She has appeared in numerous TV shows and Programs. The robot was granted Saudi Arabian Citizenship on October 25, 2017.

## What Future Holds
As we advance towards the future, we look forward to humanoids and robots evolving further and finding broader applications as they become more affordable to the more significant population. Contrary to the belief that robots will take away our jobs, it’s fair to say based on the developments that humanoids and robots will help automate repetitive jobs. These will allow humans to focus on more complex and creative tasks and create more jobs.

The market for humanoid robots is expected to be worth $3.9 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 52.1 percent between 2017 and 2023. Prediction says that bipedal robots will expand at the fastest CAGR of all humanoid robot types throughout the projection period.
Humanoid robots will answer very important philosophical questions about consciousness, life definitions, morality, emotions, etc. 

## Limitations of Humanoid Robots
While humanoid robots and AI have advanced a lot in recent years, they still have some drawbacks:
Price: Humanoid Robots are not affordable for most people. E.g. The price of the Pepper robot is about $1500 per robot.
- Maintenance: Though most robots are somewhat autonomous, they still need supervision and regular maintenance. Cost is also very high.
- Unpredictable AI: Despite being intelligent, to work in a real environment a humanoid robot must be safe and secure. Unfortunately, the field of AI Safety is very young, and researchers are still working to identify its main challenges and limitations. 
- Security and Data Privacy: As more and more robots are listening to, and analyzing data, data privacy concerns also increase exponentially.
- Influence of Bias on AI: Since most robots are trained based on data in the real world, the bias that comes with the same also impacts it. The Internet is the knowledge hub and it is also a very toxic place. Recent research shows that a face recognition algorithm could not detect an African American Woman, with 80% of images being white persons and 75% being male.

## Conclusion
Many of us are aware that robotic automation will ultimately disturb our lives. However, we are certain that our livelihoods will remain secure. They aren’t. Robotic automation will touch every commercial sector in the next few years. Robotic automation proponents frequently point out that, for the most part, robots cannot operate or program themselves — at least in near future. Theoretically, this will result in the creation of new, high-skilled employment for technicians, programmers, and other newly important tasks. Humanoid Robots with their cutting-edge technology will assist humans to open new possibilities in the future.

Despite having some limitations and drawbacks, humanoid robots still hold the candle to a very bright future for humanity.
